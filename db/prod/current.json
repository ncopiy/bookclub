      "annotation": "Давным-давно жил да был в Рукиной слободе Арсений. Судьба его не щадила: совсем маленьким он остался сиротой, родители погибли от мора. С тех пор будущего целителя воспитывал дед Христофор, который успевает передать Арсению секреты врачевания.\nА потом в жизни повзрослевшего и возмужавшего главного героя происходит страшная трагедия: гибнет его возлюбленная Устина и их ребенок.\nЭта тяжелая потеря превращает талантливого врача в юродивого, стремящегося исцелить всех нуждающихся и помочь каждому человеку с помощью трав и молитв. Так начинается сложный и долгий путь старца Лавра…",

      "annotation": "Under the streets of London lies a world most people could never dream of.\nWhen Richard Mayhew stops to help a girl he finds bleeding in the street, his unremarkable life changes in an instant.\nThis act of kindness leads him to a place filled with murderers and angels, pale girls in black velvet, a Beast in a labyrinth and an Earl who holds Court in a tube train. It is strangely familiar yet utterly bizarre.\nHere is London Below, the city of people who have fallen between the cracks. And for Richard Mayhew, it's just the beginning.",
      "quotes": [
        "Richard paused for a moment. If ever, he decided, they made disorganization an Olympic sport, he could be disorganized for Britain",
        "He calls himself the marquis de Carabas,\" he said. \"He's a fraud and a cheat and possibly even something of a monster. If you're ever in trouble, go to him. He will protect you, girl. He has to.",
        "\"What's it like then?\" asked Old Bailey. \"Being dead?\"The marquis sighed. And then he twisted his lips up into a smile, and with a glitter of his old self, he replied, \"Live long enough, Old Bailey, and you can find out for yourself.",
        "He nodded to himself, glumly, hoping to give the vague impression of being a man in need of a corpse who was disappointed by the selection but was going to have to make do with what they had.",
        "Gary was talking about taxis. He was not saying anything original, or even interesting. He was simply fulfilling his obligation as a Londoner to grumble about taxis.",
        "Richard had noticed that events were cowards: they didn't occur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once",
        "Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had set up their home in the cellar of a Victorian hospital, closed down ten years earlier because of National Health Service budget cutbacks.",
        "Lost Property. Roll up, roll up, and see for yourself. Lost property. None of your found things here. Everything guaranteed properly lost.",
        "After that the blood began to flow. Wet, red blood in enormous quantities, for Varney was a big man, and he had been keeping it all inside.",
        "Skies, thought Old Bailey, in a satisfied sort of a way. Never a two of them alike. Not by day nor not by night, neither. He was a bit of a connoisseur of skies, was Old Bailey, and this was a good 'un.",
        "that was okay. Nice food. And no one was trying to kill us.\"\"I'm sure that will remedy itself as the day goes on,\" said Hunter, accurately.",
        "The ATM took his card with a whirr. PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN NUMBER, it said. Richard typed in his secret pin number (D-I-C-K).",
        "\"First question. Who are you working for?\"\n\"Oh, that's an easy one,\" said Mr. Croup. \"That's a simple answer. We are working for our employer, who wishes to remain nameless.\""
